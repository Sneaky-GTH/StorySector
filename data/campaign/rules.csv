Your request to the docking queue is approved. Your comms officer helpfully mutes the chirpy, automated vid-feed presenting a bowdlerized history of the Galatia Academy and its role in providing education and research to the Persean Sector while remaining above political influence.

The landing promenade is filled with modest civilian transports, a few high-end personal craft, and, at the far end, a row of freighters offloading supplies. A junior academy agent greets you in a landing lounge with promotional paraphernalia in hand.

As you walk past the academy agent, your attention is grabbed by a tune coming from your TriPad – a scammer? An explorer out of fuel? An incoming AI inspection? You decide to…","stsec_ChOneStart_opt_yes:Pull out your TriPad.

After she stops talking, you are greeted by a barrage of beeps, some longer than others. After several seconds, it ends, the silence much appreciated by your ears, though it is quickly interrupted by a call from your comms officer. “$PlayerSirOrMadam, our technicians have already compiled the program you were receiving. It seemed to just be… pure machine code. I am sending it to your TriPad, although,” the officer pauses for a moment, wondering whether he should even be stating the obvious, “I’m not sure if running random code from a stranger on the Academy network would be an, uh.. good idea, $PlayerSirOrMadam.”",stsec_ChOneCall_cont1:Continue.,
